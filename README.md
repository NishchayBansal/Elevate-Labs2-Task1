**Cyber Security – Short Summary**
Cyber security protects systems, applications, and data from unauthorized access and cyber attacks.
It is essential for everyday services like banking, social media, messaging apps, and cloud platforms.

**CIA Triad**
Confidentiality: Ensures only authorized users can access data (e.g., bank account security).
Integrity: Ensures data remains accurate and unchanged (e.g., secure transactions).
Availability: Ensures systems remain accessible when needed (e.g., websites staying online).

**Types of Attackers**
Script Kiddies: Beginners using pre-built hacking tools.
Insiders: Authorized users misusing access.
Hacktivists: Attack for political or social reasons.
Nation-State Actors: Government-backed advanced attackers.

**Attack Surfaces**
Web applications, mobile apps, APIs, networks, and cloud infrastructure.

Vulnerabilities can exist at any stage of data flow:
User → Application → Server → Database

**Final Takeaway:**

Cyber security is about protecting data at every stage.
Understanding CIA triad, attackers, and attack surfaces helps build secure systems.
Even daily-use apps can be attacked if security is weak.
